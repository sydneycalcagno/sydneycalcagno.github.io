      <h1>My Super Cool Game!</h1>
      <h2>The Story</h2>
      <p>Once upon a time there was a purple block named Bobby. Bobby has always had a passion for bouncing.</p>
      <p>Little did Bobby know there was an evil block named Bert who hates it when Bobby jumps. Bert's evil plan is to run into Bobby so Bobby will stop bouncing.</p>
      <p>Bobby's not afraid of Bert so he keeps jumping! The more jumps Bobby gets in, the angrier Bert gets. The more angry Bert is, the faster he goes.</p>
      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <p>The goal of the game is to get as many jumps in as possible without getting hit by Bert.</p>
      <p>Use the space bar or click onto the screen to make Bobby jump! The more jumps, the more points you get. <a href="final/final.html">Click to Play!</a></p>
