    <h1> <a id="MeHeader">Sydney Calcagno</h1>
   

    <p>A hard-working University of Colorado Boulder Junior 
        completing a bachelor of science degree in Creative Technology 
        Design Engineering with a minor in Computer Science and a
        minor in Space. An out-of-the-box thinker who enjoys 
        problem-solving and has a lot of grit. Who is team-oriented and 
        has an outgoing, confident personality. Having an open mind is 
        important, relationships are key, and a solution exists for every
        problem.</p>
        
        <p>I look forward to working on the most challenging problems 
        and creating solutions through technology.</p>
